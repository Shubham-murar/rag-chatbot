# 🧠 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot with Qdrant & LangChain

This project showcases an intelligent chatbot built using the RAG architecture, combining powerful retrieval mechanisms with generative language models. The implementation leverages Qdrant for vector storage, HuggingFace Transformers for embeddings, and LangChain for pipeline orchestration.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

RAG enhances the capabilities of language models by retrieving relevant information from an external knowledge base and incorporating it into the generated response. This project demonstrates how to:

- Chunk and embed documents.
- Store and retrieve embeddings using Qdrant.
- Generate context-aware answers via LangChain's retrieval chain.
- Evaluate the quality of responses using a keyword-matching script.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rag-chatbot.git
   cd rag-chatbot
````

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

   ```
   QDRANT_URL=https://your-qdrant-url.com
   QDRANT_API_KEY=your-qdrant-api-key
   QDRANT_COLLECTION_NAME=your-collection-name
   GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
   ```

4. **Prepare Your Documents**

   Add your source `.txt` or `.pdf` files into the `documents/` folder. These will be chunked, embedded, and stored in Qdrant.

5. **Run the Bot**

   Start the RAG pipeline:

   ```bash
   python main_rag_bot.py
   ```

---

## 🧪 Evaluation

To measure the bot’s accuracy and keyword coverage, run:

```bash
python evaluate_bot.py
```

This script outputs:

* Keyword match score per question
* A final average score out of 5.0
* JSON results in `evaluation_results.json`

Example Output:

```
🎯 Final Score: 4.70 / 5.0
📄 Evaluation results saved to evaluation_results.json
```
